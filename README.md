# epa-project

Objective: 

Develop a robust monitoring solution on an Amazon EC2 instance that displays real-time metrics, logs, and security scan data on a web page, using Terraform for infrastructure as code and GitHub for source control, testing and the CI/CD pipeline. The use case for this project is to be a template that can be repurposed to make a dashboard for any future projects at JD. 

 

Project Scope: Configure EC2 instances and related resources using Terraform to create a reusable and easily repurpose able infrastructure setup. Use S3 for persistent storage of CloudWatch metrics and logs, and GitHub for version control and CI/CD pipelines. Develop a web page hosted on EC2 to display monitoring data. Implement security best practices to secure the data and access to the monitoring dashboard.
